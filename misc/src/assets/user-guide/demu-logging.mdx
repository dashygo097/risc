# DEMU Logging System 

```info
You should firstly build cpu/system simulator on your machine. make sure you have spdlog.
```
Logging system is built on top of [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog). <br/>
The logging levels are divided into 5 levels: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, and `ERROR`(from low to high).
Typically `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO` are the most informative level and are used for debugging, while `WARN` and `ERROR` are used to indicate potential issues or errors in the system. <br/>

| Log Level | Description 
| --- | --- 
| `TRACE` | The most detailed level of logging, providing information about every step of the execution process. It is typically used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
| `DEBUG` | Provides detailed information about the execution process, but is less verbose than ` TRACE`. It is often used for debugging and development purposes.
| `INFO` | Provides general information about the execution process, such as the start and end of a process, or the values of important variables. It is often used for monitoring and tracking the execution of a program.
| `WARN` | Indicates a potential issue or problem that may not necessarily cause the program to fail, but should be investigated. It is often used to indicate a situation that may require attention or action.
| `ERROR` | Indicates a serious issue or problem that has occurred, which may cause the program to fail or produce incorrect results. It is often used to indicate a situation that requires immediate attention or action.

Some debug options are controlled by the level of logging, for example, the `--show-pipeline` option will print all the pipeline states of cpu when the logging level is set to `TRACE` or `DEBUG`. So the `--show-pipeline` info is at the level of `DEBUG`.

```tip
Note that the logging level is set by -L parameter with the excutables.(e.g. -L4 -> WARN, -L1 -> TRACE)
```

## CPU Simulator 
Here are the levels of the logging options for cpu simulator:
| Options | Log Level | Description
| --- | --- | ---
| `--dump-regs` | `INFO` | Dump the general purpose register' values.
| `--dump-mem` | `INFO` | Dump the memory for selected address range.
| `--show-pipeline` | `DEBUG` | Show the pipeline states of cpu.

## System Simulator
Here are the levels of the logging options for system simulator:
| Options | Log Level | Description
| --- | --- | ---
| `--dump-mem` | `INFO` | Dump the memory for selected address range.
